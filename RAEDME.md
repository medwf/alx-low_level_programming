# alx-low level programming

### About
- This repository consists of all the C programming projects done with ALX Africa Full stack Software Engineering.
- All main.c files are prewritten by the school. We build functions that produce a specific output while also taking into consideration edge cases.

- C is fun but its not that easy, so I have some notes that will actually show you the journey and thought process.

### Project
- 0x00 : Hello, World.
