# 0x14-bit_manipulation.

## about.
   - Look for the right source of information without too much help
   - How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## Task mandatory.
0. Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int. `you can use << bitwise to add 1 to left if *b == 1`.
1. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number. `try to look at bitwise AND and >> shift`
2. Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
