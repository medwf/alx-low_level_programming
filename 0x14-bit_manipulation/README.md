# 0x14-bit_manipulation.

## about.
   - Look for the right source of information without too much help
   - How to manipulate bits and use bitwise operators

## Task mandatory.
0. Write a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int. `you can use << bitwise to add 1 to left if *b == 1`.
1. Write a function that prints the binary representation of a number. `try to look at bitwise AND and >> shift`
2. Write a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
3. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
4. Write a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index.
5. Write a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.

## Task advance.
6. Write a function that checks the endianness.
7. Find the password for this program.
